Inspired by [Andrew Hill's post](http://andrewxhill.com/blog/2015/04/17/torque-unknown/) on alternative methods using Torque maps, I wanted to play around with other ways to display the Twitter data I posted about [last week](http://www.nickwilgruber.com/maps/WUGC2016/). Again, I'm using tweets with the hashtag WUGC2016 pulled over a 30 day period. 

### Bubbles

This is the more striking map of the two. As people tweet in a given location, the bubbles expand. The visualization, I think, makes it a little easier to see Twitter activity in areas with less tweets. On the other end of that, I love how chaotic the UK gets as the bubbles expand. It's visually quite fun. 

### Static tweets

While not as stunning (or as animated), this map makes the range location of tweets clear. There's hundreds a tweets around London, but South Africa and the Philippines also have a strong twitter presence.

Alright. Enough Twitter maps for now.
