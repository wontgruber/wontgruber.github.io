This past week, the [World Ultimate and Guts Championships](http://wugc2016.com/) (WUGC) were held in London. The [USA swept all divisions](http://ultiworld.com/2016/06/25/usa-sweep/), Team Canada's Danielle Fortin had that [incredible greatest](https://www.facebook.com/UltimateCanada/videos/1286956634647900/), and people around the globe tweeted about the championships. I have been thinking about playing with twitter data some time now, particularly with respect to ultimate. WUGC is an international event and it lends itself well to showing ultimateâ€™s influence around the world. With the hashtag #WUGC2016 prominently displayed on the WUGC website and plenty of tweets using it, I was hopeful I could make something cool.

### The Map

CartoDB makes this kind of map easy to make. I pulled tweets with #WUGC2016 over a 30 day period, styled a bit with CSS, and used torque.js to animate tweets by time.

### Allow me to get nerdy for a minute... 
The map is cool to look at. However, don't go trying to derive any strong scientific conclusions from it. **There are a few things to note here:** This map only uses geolocated tweets (i.e. Tweets that have location data enabled). Geolocated tweets make up about 5% of all tweets -- so this is a small (and not necessarily representative) sample. CartoDB uses what they call "geo-enrichment" to increase those Twitter search results up to 15% to 20%. Much of that additional 10% - 15% seems to come from tweets that have country-specific location data -- but no finer geographic detail. In those cases, CartoDB uses a fixed point near the geographic center of that country to plot the tweet location. As a result, there are tweets popping up in places you might not expect. Go back and watch the animation again. A constant stream of tweets from northern Kansas? The Northwest Territories in Canada? The middle of Sibuyan Sea in the Philippines? Doubtful.  

Enjoy the eye candy. There are more maps coming soon.
