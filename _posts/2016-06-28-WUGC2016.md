This past week, the World Ultimate and Guts Championships were held in London. I have been wanting to play around with twitter data for awhile, particularly with respect to ultimate. WUGC is an international event, as such, it lends itself well to mapping. I was curious to see what the hashtag #WUGC2016 results would be. Could I see tweets from each competitors home of origin? 

The map/visualization is pretty cool to look at, 

Some caveats: I can only map tweets that are geolocated (only ~5 or 10% of tweets).
