This past week, the World Ultimate and Guts Championships (WUGC) were held in London. I have been wanting to play around with twitter data for awhile, particularly with respect to ultimate. WUGC is an international event, as such, it lends itself well to mapping. I was curious to see what the hashtag #WUGC2016 results would be. Could I see tweets from each team's country of origin? Would I have enough tweets to make an interesting map (only tweets that are geolocated are map-able and they make only 5 or 10% of all tweets)?

Enjoy the eye candy. There's more to come.
