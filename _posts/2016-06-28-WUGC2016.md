This past week, the World Ultimate and Guts Championships (WUGC) were held in London. I have been wanting to play around with twitter data for awhile, particularly with respect to ultimate. WUGC is an international event, as such, it lends itself well to mapping. With the hashtag #WUGC2016 prominently displayed on the WUGC website and plently of tweets using it, I was hopeful I could make something cool.

###Allow me to get nerdy for a mintue... 
The map is cool to look at. There's no disputing that. However, don't go trying to derive any strong scientific conclusions from it. **There's a few things to note here:** This map only uses geolocated tweets (i.e. Tweets that have location data enabled). Geolocated tweets only make up about 5% of all tweets -- so this is a small (and not necessarily representative) sample. CartoDB uses what they call "geo-enrichment" to increase those Twitter search results up to 15% to 20%. Much of that additonal 10% - 15% seems to come from tweets that have country-specific data -- but no finer geographic detail. In those cases, CartoDB uses a fixed point near the geographic center of that country to plot the tweet location. As a result, there are tweets popping up in places you might not expect. Go back and watch the animation again. A constant stream of tweets from northern Kansas? The Northwest Territories, CA? The middle of Sibuyan Sea in the Philippines? Doubtful.  

Enjoy the eye candy. There are more maps coming soon.
