Nick is a mapper, learner, and thinker currently living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has spent time working or studying in environmental science, education, planning, geography -- and more recently programming. Nick enjoys playing with data to make maps that tell a story, make you think, or have a little fun (ideally all three). He also plays a lot of frisbee.
